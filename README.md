The provided SQL script is designed to create and manage the database schema for a railway system. The script starts by dropping the schema railway_system if it exists and then recreating it. This ensures a clean setup of the database. Several tables are then created to store information relevant to the railway system's operations.
user_login table holds information about users who log into the system, including their personal details and sign-up dates.
passenger table stores the data of passengers, overlapping with some of the user data but with additional fields like contact details.
train_type defines different types of trains and their associated characteristics like coach count and passenger strength.
stations table contains station data such as station names, cities, and states.
train_details stores the data of individual trains, linking train types to stations and defining the duration and availability of the train.
journey table records passenger journeys, booking details, and payment status.
train_routes manages the specific routes a train takes, including the order of stations, estimated arrival and departure times, and halt duration.
The script ensures relational integrity using foreign keys to link related tables, such as train_type, stations, and train_details. This database design is crucial for managing a railway system efficiently.
